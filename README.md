Create a class to represent your dinosaurs. The class should have the following properties

Name
DietType - This will be "carnivore" or "herbivore"
WhenAcquired - This will default to the current time when the dinosaur is created
Weight - How heavy the dinosaur is in pounds.
EnclosureNumber - the number of the pen the dinosaur is in
Add a method Description to your class to print out a description of the dinosaur to include all the properties. Create an output format of your choosing. Feel free to be creative.

Keep track of your dinosaurs in a List<Dinosaur>.

When the console application runs, it should let the user choose one of the following actions:

[View]
This command will show the all the dinosaurs in the list, ordered by WhenAcquired. If there aren't any dinosaurs in the park then print out a message that there aren't any.
[Add]
This command will let the user type in the information for a dinosaur and add it to the list. Prompt for the Name, Diet Type, Weight and Enclosure Number, but the WhenAcquired must be supplied by the code.
[Remove]
This command will prompt the user for a dinosaur name then find and delete the dinosaur with that name.
[Transfer]
This command will prompt the user for a dinosaur name and a new EnclosureNumber and update that dino's information.
[Summary]
This command will display the number of carnivores and the number of herbivores.
[Quit]
This will stop the program
